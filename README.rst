Welcome! This is the README for the distributed gene quantification
framework Tentacle.

Tentacle lets you compute coverage on very large metagenomic data sets using distributed computing resoources controlled by e.g. Slurm. 
Mapping can be performed using a range of popular mappers, including Bowtie 2, USEARCH, BLAT, and BLAST.

The complete documentation for Tentacle is available online at 
http://bioinformatics.math.chalmers.se/tentacle/.

Overview
********
The Tentacle framework is developed to enable researchers to leverage 
high-performance computer (HPC) systems to quantify genes in large 
metagenomic data sets.


What to use it for
******************
Tentacle is well suited for the following tasks:

 * Map samples of metagenomic reads back to previously annotated contigs
   to determine the presence and abundance of certain genes.
 * Map metagenomic reads to a reference database of e.g. antibiotic 
   resistance genes. 
 *
